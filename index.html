        <h1>The sun</h1>
        <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity. </p>

                      <strong>This is the third main characteristics of the sun.</strong> The core is the hottest part of the Sun, at 15 million degrees Celsius. This is hot enough to sustain thermonuclear fusion, when hydrogen atoms are fused together to form larger helium atoms. This releases an extraordinary amount of energy which in turn is released as heat and light.

                      The energy produced at the core takes up to a million years to reach the outer layer known as the convective zone. At this point the temperature drops to around two million degrees Celsius. By the time it gets to the surface the temperature is down to a much cooler 5,973°C - but it's still hot enough to boil diamonds.
                      
                      In the Sun's atmosphere, known as the corona, the temperature begins to rise again to roughly two million degrees Celsius. As distance from the core of the Sun grows wider, the temperature would be expected to drop. This dramatic increase in temperature in the atmosphere is one of the star's biggest mysteries.  <code>.accordion-body</code>
